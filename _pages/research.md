## Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)

### Transport of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in a dolomite aquifer

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) represent a significant human health risk if present in aquifers used as a drinking water source. Accurate assessment of PFAS exposure risks requires an improved understanding of field-scale PFAS transport in groundwater. Activities in the 1970s at a former firefighter training site in University Park, Pennsylvania introduced perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to the underlying dolomite aquifer. Groundwater sampling of 18 wells from 2015 to 2018 delineated a PFOS plume with two concentration maxima located ~20 and ~220 m downgradient of the training site, separated by a zone of lower concentrations. Based on analytical and numerical groundwater flow and transport models informed by field and laboratory data, we propose that heterogeneity in bedrock organic carbon content (OC) is responsible for the observed plume separation. Dissolved PFOS readily partitions to organic solids, so even low-level OC in aquifer materials significantly limits PFOS transport, while near-zero OC allows for conservative transport. This study highlights an important consideration for modeling the groundwater transport of PFOS: In aquifers with discrete layers of varying OC, models using a uniform site average OC could underestimate PFOS transport distances, thereby misrepresenting exposure risks for down-gradient communities.

### Loading history and fate of perfluoroalkyl acids in soils irrigated with treated wastewater effluent

Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), a group of synthetic compounds associated with adverse human health impacts, are commonly found in effluent discharged from wastewater treatment facilities. When this treated wastewater effluent is used for agricultural irrigation and/or artificial groundwater recharge, the long-term environmental fate of PFAAs depends strongly on vadose zone solute retention properties. Efforts to determine which soil properties are the primary controls on PFAA retention in the vadose zone have consisted predominantly of laboratory studies, so the relative importance of the retention factors under complex natural conditions remains uncertain. Additionally, a lack of historical records of PFAA wastewater effluent concentrations prevents a comprehensive accounting of PFAA storage in the environment. Using soil cores collected from the Penn State Living Filter (irrigated with treated wastewater effluent for nearly 60 years), we evaluated the soil properties controlling PFAA transport in soils under near-natural conditions, and estimated historical PFAA concentrations in the irrigated effluent. Concentrations of five PFAAs correlated (p < 0.05) with soil organic carbon content, and correlation strength generally increased with PFAA carbon chain length. Total perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) masses stored in the Living Filter soils in 2014 were more than 450 times greater than the masses applied during the 2020 effluent irrigation. Equilibrium piston-flow transport models were used to reproduce the observed PFOS and PFOA profiles, allowing us to estimate historical effluent PFOS and PFOA concentrations: 70-170 ng L-1 and 1000-1300 ng L-1, respectively. The estimated concentrations were comparable to concentrations measured in several WWTP effluents in 1999 and the mid-2000s, indicating that when interpreted with transport modeling, wastewater-irrigated soils can function as integrated records of historical PFAA loading. Simulated PFOS breakthrough to groundwater occurred 50 years after the start of wastewater irrigation, while PFOA breakthrough occurred after only 10 years of irrigation. Thus, while wastewater irrigation reduces effluent PFAA discharges to surface waters, it increases PFAA storage in soils, which can then become long-term sources of PFAAs to groundwater.

## Nitrate retention in Oxisols

The replacement of natural forests with cropland is rapidly changing the landscape of the Brazilian Amazon-Cerrado ecotone, and the region is expected to play an important role in the future of the global food supply. Deforestation and intensive cropping are typically accompanied by nitrate pollution of water resources, but Oxisols, highly weathered soils common in the Amazon-Cerrado region, appear to buffer groundwater and surface water against excess nitrate pollutions. While geochemical controls on nitrate fate in tropical soils are well documented, the role of Oxisol hydrology has not been adequately studied. Using measurements of infiltration rates and soil water contents, and soil water samples collected from tension lysimeters, we investigated soil hydraulic property variability and nitrate distributions in deep Oxisols beneath natural forest and soybean cropland in Mato Grosso, Brazil. High saturated hydraulic conductivities and rapid percolation rates were measured to depths of 1-2 m below ground surface (bgs), and were attributed to strong microaggregation present in Oxisols. The rapid flow along preferential flow paths in the upper two meters appears to limit nitrate adsorption in those soils, leading to greater nitrate accumulation deeper in the soil profile. While nitrate storage in the top 2 m has not changed significantly over the past decade, masses stored in soils below 2 m appear to be growing. Comparisons of nitrate concentrations in soil water, groundwater, and stream water show that vadose zone soils are currently the primary sink for nitrate in both forest and cropland watersheds. However, should vadose zone adsorption capacity become saturated in the future, riparian zones should continue to buffer stream water against nitrate pollution.
