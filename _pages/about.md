I am a hydrogeologist investigating physical and chemical controls on water flow and solute transport in vadose zones and shallow aquifers. I use numerical models, field tests, and laboratory techniques to quantify water and solute fluxes and characterize soil/bedrock hydraulic and chemical properties. My research focuses on the fate of emerging anthropogenic contaminants, and the fate of legacy contaminants in under-studied environments. It is important to me that my research help inform water resource management practices for sustaining water quality and availability in the future.

Research Interests
------
- poly- and perfluoroalkyl (PFAS) retention and transport in vadose zone soils and bedrock aquifers
- nitrate accumulation in Oxisols beneath soybean croplands in Brazil
